# Calculator
Bug: 
1./
Doesn't display full expression when hit "=" sign 
if firstOperand - secondOperand = 0
2./
Doesn't display anything when calculate with number 0
3./
Doesn't display correctly when 0 is the first operand
4./
Doesn't display anything when 0 is the dividend

Will try to fix them later in the future
